This Jupyter Notebook provides an approach that uses Python to import Sentinel-2 satellite imagery for a given region of interest and a given time span. It then produces an interactive web map using the Folium leaflet library.

Satellite imagery from Sentinel-2 taken before and after the 2020 Kyushu Floods in Japan. The top row show bands B4, B3, B2, and the bottom row shows NDWI normalized bands for B3, B5.
